    <h1>UI Component for Vue.js</h1>
    <p>
      This is a UI component dev environment for your vue app.
    </p>
    <p>
      This component based on
      <a
          class="link"
          href="https://getbootstrap.com/"
          target="_blank"
      >

    <p>
      We've added some basic stories inside the
      <code class="code">stories</code>
      directory.
      <br />
      A story is a single state of one or more UI components.
      You can have as many stories as you want.
      <br />
      (Basically a story is like a visual test case.)
